# Image Classification Project

## Description
This project is an image classification system using machine learning. It processes images, extracts features, and classifies them into predefined categories. The implementation is done using a Jupyter Notebook.

## Features
- Preprocessing and augmentation of images.
- Training a deep learning model for classification.
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy and loss metrics.
- Visualization of classification results.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure Python is installed on your system. Install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn opencv-python
```

## Usage
To run the image classification model, execute the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook imgclass.ipynb
```

## File Structure
- `imgclass.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training and evaluating the model.
- `data/` - Directory containing image dataset.
- `logs/` - Directory containing logs.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How It Works
1. Loads the dataset and applies preprocessing.
2. Augments images for better generalization.
3. Trains a deep learning model.
4. Evaluates model accuracy and loss.
5. Visualizes results using graphs.

## Future Improvements
- Implement a more complex CNN architecture.
- Fine-tune the model for better accuracy.
- Deploy the model as a web application.

## License
This project is open-source and available for modification and distribution.
